                            <p>Hi, I'm Jenessa Calixte, I am a first year student Algonquin College in the Graphic Design Program. I live in Ottawa and have since I was a kid. What inspired me to apply to this program was my dad. I just finished my last year in Pre Animation, and was initially planning to take a gap year after graduation but then he mentioned graphic design, and explained that it is a mix of many different digital arts, and typography.  </p>
                                
                            <p> I find that I am still inspired in this program, I could even say I feel even more inspired than I was at the start. I find that my main motivation is that, with all the learning materials in this program I have a better shot of finding a financially stable job after I graduate. I also think having made friends over the course of last semester helped me stay motivated for this new year. I think my strongest asset as a designer is my problem solving mindset. I think that anything has a solution, you just need to find it.</p>
